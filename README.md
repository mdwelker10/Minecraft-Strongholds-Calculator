# Minecraft Stronghold Locator

For Minecraft Java Edition Versions 1.9 and later assuming there are no major changes to Stronghold
generation.
This is NOT a Minecraft Speedrun Stronghold location calculator, unless the speedrun is All Portals
1.9+

## What It Does

- This program will take the coordinates of a single stronghold found by the player and give
  apporximated coordinates for every other stronghold in that ring.
- This is mostly useful for servers where access to /seed is not allowed, so other resources
  like [Chunkbase](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/stronghold-finder) would not work.
- This program does not read from any game files and simply performs a series of trigonometric
  calculations

## Stronghold Generation Quick Summary

- Strongholds in Minecraft Java Edition generate in 8 rings with the origin (0,0) as the center
  point.
- These rings have (in order from closest to farthest from the origin) 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, and
  9 Strongholds for a total of 128 Strongholds.
- All Strongholds will generate at a random distance within the bounds of each ring, with each ring
  having a thickness of about 1536 blocks.
- Each Stronghold in a ring will generate at an about equal angle apart when measuring from the
  origin.

![Minecraft Stronghold Generation rings with the distances from the origin and number of strongholds in each ring](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/minecraft_gamepedia/images/9/9d/Strongholds_1.9.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/400?cb=20210212055544)

Each Stronghold has what can be referred to as a "starter staircase" which is the highest point in
the Stronghold, a staircase that leads down into the Stronghold but there is nothing at the top.
This starter staircase generates in the same [chunk](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk) (a
16x16 block section of the world) that the Eye of Ender points to when locating the Stronghold. The
Eye of Ender will always point to the center of this chunk. In order to be as accurate as possible,
the coordinates that should be put into the program are the coordinates of the player standing at
the center of this staircase. If this method of getting the coordinates is too confusing then there
are two other options:

1. Go up to the surface and find the place where the Eye of Ender points down into the ground and
   use those coordinates. This will be slightly less accurate.
2. Pick a random place in the Stronghold and use those coordiantes. The accuracy of this will range
   from slightly less accurate to very inacurate depending on where in the Stronghold the
   coordinates are gotten from.

## How It Works

The program uses the X and Z coordinates input by the player of the location of a Stronghold and
performs simple Trigonometric calculations to determine the approximate location of the other
Strongholds in the same ring as the given Stronghold. The user can display these coordinates in
Nether Coordinates in order to travel to the calculated location faster. A summary of the process is
outlined below.

1. The user provides the program with the X and Z coordinates of a Stronghold that has already been
   located
2. The user decides whether to display the Overworld coordinates or Nether coordinates and presses
   the calculate button
3. The program uses the Pythagorean theorem to determine the distance the Stronghold is from the
   origin and therefore what ring it is in
4. The program then uses the ring number to determine the number of Strongholds in the ring and
   therefore the angle between them
5. The program calculates the mean distance from the origin Strongholds can generate in the ring and
   uses it as the hypotenuse of a right triangle to then do more calculations
6. Using Trig properties for right triangles (SOHCAHTOA) The program calculates the apporximate
   coordiantes of the other Strongholds in the ring

The user can remove coordinates from the list as they find Strongholds and reset the UI for their
next calculation.

## Notes

- Accuracy tends to go down the farther from the origin the Stronghold is.
- If a Stronghold tries to generate in certain places such as an Ocean, Swamp, or River, it may "
  snap" to a different biome it is allowed to generate in if it is close enough. This can have 2
  effects:
    - The Stronghold position might slightly outside one of the rings
    - The angle used to calculate might be incorrect and lead to the distance between the Stronghold
      position and calculated position being farther than normal
- If the given Stronghold coordinates are calculated to be outside of a ring, the program will ask
  the user if they want to enter the ring manually, have the program guess which ring it is in, or
  try to enter the coordinates again in case a mistake was made.
- Currently there is no method to prevent calculation errors if the angle is calculated wrong due to
  the Stronghold snapping to a different location. In rare cases this can lead to two calculated
  coordinate positions having the Eye of Ender point to the same Stronghold.
